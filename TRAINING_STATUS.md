# Training Started Successfully! 🚀

## Status: RUNNING

The improved PPO training has been successfully started on the 10-year synthetic dataset.

---

## Initial Results (First 10 Episodes)

### ✅ What's Working:
- **Data Loading**: 350,688 timesteps from 10-year synthetic data ✓
- **Learning Happening**: Return improved from -110k → **-103,059** in 10 episodes ✓  
- **Reliability**: Unmet demand = 0 (no blackouts) ✓
- **Environment**: Observation space (90), Action space (5) ✓

### ⚠️ What Needs Improvement:
- **Safety Violations**: Still at 70 per episode (target: < 5)
  - *Solution*: Needs more training episodes + potentially higher safety multiplier
- **Actor Loss**: 0.0000 indicates policy not updating yet
  - *Solution*: Need to accumulate batch_size (2048) experiences before first update

## How Training Is Going

### Episode Progress:
```
Episode 1:  -107,946 ← Initial random policy
Episode 2:  -105,116 ✓ Improving
Episode 3:  -103,059 ✓ Best so far
...
Episode 10: -103,405
Average(10): -109,947
```

### Current Metrics (Episode 10):
- **Return**: -103,405 (improving toward 0)

- **Emissions**: 6,925 kg CO₂ per episode
- **Safety Violations**: 70 (needs reduction)
- **Unmet Demand**: 0 ✓

---

## What Happens Next

### Phase 1: Batch Accumulation (Episodes 1-22)
The agent collects 2,048 experiences before the first policy update.
- **Episodes Needed**: ~22 (96 steps/episode × 22 ≈ 2,048)
- **Expected**: Actor/Critic losses become non-zero
- **Goal**: First gradient updates

### Phase 2: Early Learning (Episodes 23-200)
Policy starts optimizing after first update.
- **Expected**: Safety violations begin decreasing
- **Expected**: Return steadily improving
- **Goal**: Return > -90,000, Safety < 40

### Phase 3: Convergence (Episodes 200-1000)
Fine-tuning and policy refinement.
- **Expected**: Safety violations < 10
- **Expected**: Return > -60,000
- **Goal**: Production-ready policy

## Monitoring Training

### Check Logs:
```bash
# In a new terminal:
cd D:\IIT_GAN\Version_2\microgrid-ems-drl
dir logs\ppo_improved_*
```

### View Real-time Progress:
Training prints progress every 10 episodes:
```
Episode 10/1000
  Return: -103405.30 | Avg(100): -109947.25
  Cost: ₹36990.97 | Emissions: 6924.6 kg
  Safety Violations: 70 | Unmet: 0
  Actor Loss: 0.0000 | Critic Loss: 0.0000 | Entropy: 0.0000
```

### Check Saved Models:
Best models are saved automatically:
```bash
dir models\ppo_improved_*\best_model.pt
```

---

## Training Outputs

### Files Being Generated:

1. **logs/ppo_improved_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/**
   - `training_metrics.csv` - Full numerical log
   - `training_curves.png` - 6-panel visualization (every 100 episodes)

2. **models/ppo_improved_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/**
   - `best_model.pt` - Best model so far (updated whenever return improves)
   - `checkpoint_ep100.pt` - Checkpoint every 100 episodes
   - `checkpoint_ep200.pt`
   - ...

---

## Expected Timeline

Based on previous training (~1-2 minutes per 10 episodes):

- **100 episodes**: ~10-20 minutes
- **500 episodes**: ~1-2 hours  
- **1000 episodes**: ~2-4 hours (full training)

**Recommendation**: Let it run for at least 200-300 episodes to see clear improvement patterns.

---

## What To Do While Training

### Option 1: Monitor (Recommended)
Check progress periodically:
```powershell
# Every 30 minutes, check the terminal output
# Look for decreasing safety violations
# Ensure return is improving
```

### Option 2: Run in Background
The training will continue in the background terminal. You can:
- Work on other tasks
- Prepare presentation materials
- Review documentation (HACKATHON_READY.md, INDIAN_CONTEXT.md)

### Option 3: Test Short Run First
If unsure, stop training (Ctrl+C) after 50-100 episodes and:
- Check training_curves.png
- Verify metrics make sense
- Adjust hyperparameters if needed
- Restart for full 1000 episodes

## If Training Fails

### Common Issues & Solutions:

**Issue 1: Safety violations not decreasing**
```python
# In train_ppo_improved.py, line 658:
safety_weight_multiplier = 5.0  # Increase from 3.0
```

**Issue 2: Training crashes with "Out of Memory"**
```python
# In train_ppo_improved.py:
batch_size = 1024  # Reduce from 2048
minibatch_size = 256  # Reduce from 512
```

**Issue 3: Return oscillating wildly**
```python
# In train_ppo_improved.py:
learning_rate = 5e-5  # Reduce from 1e-4
```

**Issue 4: No improvement after 200 episodes**
- Check training_curves.png for diagnosis
- Verify actor_loss and critic_loss are non-zero
- Consider curriculum learning (start simpler, increase complexity)

## Success Indicators (Check After 200 Episodes)

### Must See:
✅ Return trending upward (less negative)
✅ Safety violations decreasing (even if slowly)
✅ Unmet demand remains 0
✅ Actor loss & critic loss non-zero and relatively stable

### Nice to See:
✅ Cost decreasing
✅ Emissions decreasing  
✅ Entropy decaying slowly (not to zero)
✅ "NEW BEST MODEL" messages appearing regularly

---

## After Training Completes

### Evaluate Best Model:
```bash
python evaluate.py --model models/ppo_improved_*/best_model.pt --episodes 100
```

### Create Visualizations:
```bash
# Training curves (auto-generated every 100 episodes)
# Check: logs/ppo_improved_*/training_curves.png
```

### Compare with Baseline:
```bash
# Original model: -94,535 return, 70 safety violations
# Improved model: Target > -60,000 return, < 5 safety violations
```
