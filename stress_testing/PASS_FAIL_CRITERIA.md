# üìä Pass/Fail Criteria Explained

## How Tests Are Evaluated

Each test suite has **specific pass/fail criteria** designed to validate different aspects of system robustness. Here's the complete breakdown:

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Edge Cases Suite (`test_edge_cases.py`)

### **Purpose**: Test operational boundaries without crashes

### **Pass Criteria** (ALL must be true):
```python
‚úÖ unmet_demand_events ‚â§ 25 events
‚úÖ system_health ‚â• 50%
‚úÖ total_cost < ‚Çπ1,000,000 (for 1 day)
‚úÖ No system crashes
```

### **Fail Criteria** (ANY triggers failure):
```python
‚ùå unmet_demand_events > 25
‚ùå system_health < 50%
‚ùå total_cost > ‚Çπ1,000,000
‚ùå System crashes/exceptions
```

### **Scenario-Specific Adjustments**:

#### **Zero Renewable**:
- Cost should be high (> ‚Çπ10,000) - validates grid import needed
- Allowed expensive scenarios: zero_renewable, grid_failure, extreme_load_spike

#### **Max Renewable**:
- Cost should be low (< ‚Çπ50,000) - validates renewable usage
- May even have negative cost (selling to grid)

### **Why These Numbers?**

**Unmet Demand (25 events):**
- With random actions: ~25% of steps may have small unmet demand
- With trained agent: Should drop to <5 events
- Critical threshold: System shouldn't fail more than 25% of time

**Cost (‚Çπ1M):**
- Average Indian microgrid: ‚Çπ200-400k/day
- Random actions: ~‚Çπ500-600k/day (expected)
- ‚Çπ1M = 2.5x normal cost = critical failure
- Note: ‚Çπ600-999k triggers warning but not failure

**Health (50%):**
- Below 50% = critically degraded equipment
- Should trigger emergency maintenance
- Random actions shouldn't degrade this much in 1 day

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Extreme Conditions Suite (`test_extreme_conditions.py`)

### **Purpose**: Validate survival in emergencies

### **Three-Tier Classification**:

#### **üî¥ CRITICAL FAILURE** (System unusable):
```python
‚ùå system_crashes > 0                  # Environment crashed
‚ùå steps_completed < 48                # Can't run 12+ hours
‚ùå Exception/Error during test         # Python crash
```
**Action Required**: MUST FIX before deployment

---

#### **‚ö†Ô∏è DEGRADED** (System survived but struggled):
```python
‚ö†Ô∏è final_health < 30%                 # Severe degradation
‚ö†Ô∏è unmet_demand_total > 500 kWh       # Can't meet demand
‚ö†Ô∏è Scenario-specific issues           # Poor performance
```
**Status**: Acceptable for extreme conditions, optimize if possible

---

#### **‚úÖ SURVIVED** (Acceptable performance):
```python
‚úÖ steps_completed ‚â• 48                # At least 12 hours
‚úÖ system_crashes = 0                  # No crashes
‚úÖ final_health ‚â• 30%                  # Survival mode OK
‚úÖ unmet_demand_total ‚â§ 500 kWh       # Reasonable
```
**Status**: System is robust!

### **Scenario-Specific Thresholds**:

#### **Heat Wave**:
```python
‚ö†Ô∏è final_health < 60%  # Poor thermal management
Expected: High unmet demand (degraded PV + high AC load)
```

#### **Grid Blackout**:
```python
‚ö†Ô∏è unmet_demand_events > 30  # Can't maintain supply
Expected: Cost = ‚Çπ0 (no grid available)
```

#### **Extended Cloudy**:
```python
‚ö†Ô∏è total_cost > ‚Çπ1,000,000  # Excessive grid reliance
Expected: Higher costs (no solar for 7 days)
```

### **Why These Numbers?**

**Steps Completed (48 = 12 hours):**
- Must survive at least half a day under extreme stress
- Critical for emergency response scenarios

**Health (30%):**
- Below 30% = equipment failure imminent
- 30-60% = degraded but operational (survival mode)
- Above 60% = acceptable performance

**Unmet Demand (500 kWh):**
- For 96 steps (24 hours): ~5 kWh per step
- ~10-15% of typical 3500 kW load
- Acceptable during extreme conditions

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Real-World Scenarios Suite (`test_real_world_scenarios.py`)

### **Purpose**: Validate realistic Indian microgrid patterns

### **Pass Criteria** (ALL must be true):
```python
‚úÖ unmet_demand_kwh ‚â§ 100 kWh          # Over 24 hours
‚úÖ final_health ‚â• 70%                  # Good health
‚úÖ No system crashes
```

### **Fail Criteria** (ANY triggers failure):
```python
‚ùå unmet_demand_kwh > 100 kWh
‚ùå final_health < 70%
‚ùå System crashes
```

### **Scenario-Specific Checks**:

#### **Summer Peak**:
```python
‚ö†Ô∏è total_cost > ‚Çπ150,000  # Warning for high cost
Expected: High cost due to AC load + peak pricing
```

#### **Monsoon Season**:
```python
‚ö†Ô∏è renewable_usage > 60%  # Unrealistic during monsoon
Expected: Low renewable (20-40%), high grid usage
```

#### **EV Rush Hour**:
```python
‚ö†Ô∏è unmet_demand > 50 kWh  # Can't handle charging surge
Expected: Some unmet demand during 6-8 PM surge
```

### **Why These Numbers?**

**Unmet Demand (100 kWh):**
- Over 24 hours = ~4 kWh per hour
- ~1 kWh per 15-min interval
- <3% of typical 3500 kW load
- Real-world acceptable threshold

**Health (70%):**
- Above 70% = normal operations
- Below 70% = maintenance needed
- Real-world scenarios shouldn't degrade much

**Cost (‚Çπ150,000 for summer):**
- Normal: ‚Çπ200-400k/day
- Summer peak: up to ‚Çπ600k/day (with random actions)
- ‚Çπ150k is ambitious, ‚Çπ400k is realistic
- Used as warning threshold, not hard fail

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Performance Suite (`test_performance.py`)

### **Purpose**: Validate speed, memory, and scalability

### **Pass Criteria**:

#### **Execution Speed**:
```python
‚úÖ steps_per_second > real_time_requirement
‚úÖ real_time_ratio > 1.0x

# For 15-min decision intervals:
# Real-time = 900 seconds per step
# Actual: ~0.005 seconds per step
# Ratio: 180,000x faster ‚úÖ
```

#### **Memory Usage**:
```python
‚úÖ growth_per_episode < 5 MB
‚úÖ No memory leaks (stable over 10 episodes)

# Acceptable: ¬±5 MB fluctuation
# Failure: Continuous growth >5 MB/episode
```

#### **Real-Time Constraints**:
```python
‚úÖ max_step_time < 900 seconds  # For 15-min intervals
‚úÖ p99_step_time < 900 seconds  # 99% of steps

# Current: ~0.005s (55,000x margin)
```

#### **Concurrent Environments**:
```python
‚úÖ All environments complete successfully
‚úÖ No crashes in parallel execution
‚úÖ Memory per environment < 1 GB

# Tests: 2, 4, 8 concurrent instances
```

#### **Scalability**:
```python
‚úÖ completed_steps = requested_steps
‚úÖ No crashes during long episodes
‚úÖ Memory usage stable

# Tests: 672, 1344, 2880 steps (1 week to 1 month)
```

### **Why These Numbers?**

**Real-Time (900s):**
- 15-minute decision intervals = 900 seconds
- Must make decision faster than real-time
- Current: 0.005s = 180,000x margin (excellent!)

**Memory (5 MB):**
- Modern systems have GBs of RAM
- 5 MB per episode = 200 episodes per GB
- Continuous growth = leak (bad)
- Fluctuation ¬±5 MB = normal (good)

**Scalability (2880 steps):**
- 1 month = 2880 steps (15-min intervals)
- Must complete without stopping
- Memory should remain stable

## üîß How to Adjust Criteria

If you want to make tests **more strict** (after training):

### In `test_edge_cases.py`:
```python
# Line 258-259
if metrics['unmet_demand_events'] > 10:  # Was 25
    passed = False

# Line 274
if metrics['total_cost'] > 500000:  # Was 1,000,000
    passed = False
```

### In `test_extreme_conditions.py`:
```python
# Line 318-319
if metrics['unmet_demand_total_kwh'] > 200:  # Was 500
    passed = False

# Line 323
if metrics.get('final_health', 100) < 50:  # Was 30
    passed = False
```

### In `test_real_world_scenarios.py`:
```python
# Line 365-366
if metrics['unmet_demand_kwh'] > 50:  # Was 100
    passed = False

# Line 369
if metrics['final_health'] < 80:  # Was 70
    passed = False
```
