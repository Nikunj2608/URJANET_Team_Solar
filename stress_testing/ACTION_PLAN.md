## 🚀 Quick Wins (Do These First)

### 1. Train Your RL Agent (HIGH PRIORITY) 🎓

**Why**: Your system is using random actions. A trained agent will dramatically improve performance.

**How**:
```bash
cd d:\IIT_GAN\Version_2\microgrid-ems-drl
python train_ppo_improved.py
```

**Expected improvement**: 
- From 69% → **90-95% pass rate**
- Cost reduction: **50-70%**
- Unmet demand reduction: **80-90%**

**Time**: 30-60 minutes training

---

### 2. Test with Trained Agent (VALIDATION) 🧪

After training, modify stress tests to use your model:

```python
# Add at top of test file
from stable_baselines3 import PPO
model = PPO.load("models/best_model")  # Your trained model

# In test loop, replace:
# action = env.action_space.sample()  # Old

# With:
action, _ = model.predict(obs, deterministic=True)  # New
```

**Expected results**: 
- Edge Cases: 100% → **100%** (already perfect)
- Extreme: 50% → **80-90%**
- Real-World: 44% → **85-95%**
- Overall: 69% → **90-95%**

## ⚠️ What Needs Training

### Why Random Actions Fail:

**Summer Peak (36,804 kWh unmet):**
- ❌ Random: Doesn't pre-charge batteries for peak hours
- ✅ Trained: Learns to anticipate AC surge at noon

**Diwali Festival (29,130 kWh unmet):**
- ❌ Random: Doesn't prepare for evening decorative loads
- ✅ Trained: Learns festival patterns

**Industrial 3-Shift (11,417 kWh unmet):**
- ❌ Random: Poor load balancing across shifts
- ✅ Trained: Optimizes for shift transitions

**EV Rush Hour (11,190 kWh unmet):**
- ❌ Random: Can't anticipate charging surge
- ✅ Trained: Pre-charges batteries before 6 PM

**Heat Wave (60,855 kWh unmet):**
- ❌ Random: Inefficient during degraded PV + high AC
- ✅ Trained: Learns thermal management

load_real = pd.read_csv('real_load_data.csv')

env = MicrogridEMSEnv(
    pv_profile=pv_real,
    load_profile=load_real,
    ...
)
```
