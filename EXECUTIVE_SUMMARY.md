### **Slide 2: How It Learns**
![Training](training_flow.png)

**Training Process:**
- 10-year dataset (350,688 real scenarios)
- 1,000 episodes trial & error
- Learned optimal strategy
- Validated on unseen data

**Result:** Cost dropped from ₹300k → ₹50k per day

## 🆚 **Why We're Different**

### **REACTIVE vs PROACTIVE**

| Traditional (Reactive) | Our AI (Proactive) |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| ❌ Reacts to problems | ✅ Predicts problems |
| ❌ Current state only | ✅ 2-hour forecasts |
| ❌ Fixed rules | ✅ Learns patterns |
| ❌ Misses opportunities | ✅ Plans ahead |

**Example:**
```
Scenario: Peak hour coming in 2 hours

Traditional: Waits → Pays ₹9.50/kWh
Our AI: Charges NOW at ₹4.50/kWh → Saves ₹5/kWh
```
