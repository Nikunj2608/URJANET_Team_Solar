# Training Improvements & Optimization Guide

## Overview
This document outlines all improvements implemented based on training log analysis. The system now trains on **10-year synthetic data (350,688 samples)** with optimized hyperparameters and enhanced safety mechanisms.

---

## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Safety Handling** ✓
**Problem**: High safety violations (65-80 per episode)

**Solutions Implemented**:
- **3x Safety Penalty Multiplier** - Increased from 1x to 3x in reward calculation
- **Running Safety Tracker** - Monitors violations across episodes
- **Normalized Safety Rewards** - Scaled to similar magnitude as cost/emissions
- **Action Clipping** - Already implemented via SafetySupervisor

**Expected Result**: Reduce safety violations from ~70 to **< 5 per episode**

### 2. **Observation Normalization** ✓
**Problem**: Raw observations span different scales (SoC: 0-1, Price: 4-10, Power: 0-3000)

**Solution Implemented**:
```python
class RunningNormalizer:
    - Tracks running mean & variance
    - Normalizes each observation feature
    - Updates online during training
```

**Benefit**: Stable gradients, faster convergence

### 3. **Reward Component Scaling** ✓
**Problem**: Cost (~10^5) dominates emissions (~10^3), causing suboptimal trade-offs

**Solution Implemented**:
```python
class RewardScaler:
    cost_scale = 1e-3        # Scale costs to thousands
    emission_scale = 1e-2    # Scale emissions to hundreds
    safety_scale = 1.0       # Keep safety penalty prominent
```

**Benefit**: Balanced optimization across all objectives

### 4. **Optimized PPO Hyperparameters** ✓
**Changes from Original → Improved**:

| Parameter | Original | Improved | Reason |
|-----------|----------|----------|--------|
| Learning Rate | 3e-4 | **1e-4** | Reduce oscillations |
| Batch Size | 1024 | **2048** | Lower gradient variance |
| Minibatch Size | 256 | **512** | More stable updates |
| N Epochs | 4 | **10** | Better policy utilization |
| Entropy Coef | 0.0 | **0.01** | Encourage exploration |
| Max Grad Norm | 0.5 | **0.5** | Prevent gradient explosion |
| Clip Coef | 0.2 | **0.2** | Standard PPO |
| GAE Lambda | 0.95 | **0.95** | Standard |
| Gamma | 0.99 | **0.99** | Standard |

### 5. **Improved Network Architecture** ✓
**Changes**:
- **Activation**: ReLU → **Tanh** (better for policy networks)
- **Initialization**: Orthogonal initialization with proper gain
- **Output Layer Init**: Gain 0.01 for small initial actions
- **LayerNorm**: Applied after each hidden layer

### 6. **10-Year Synthetic Dataset Integration** ✓
**Data Loading**:
```python
load_synthetic_data():
    - Loads COMPLETE_10YEAR_DATA.csv (350,688 samples)
    - Automatically converts to PV, Wind, Load, Price profiles
    - Applies Indian ToU tariff structure
    - 100x more data than original
```

**Training Benefits**:
- **Non-stationarity**: Model learns warming trends (+0.03°C/year)
- **Seasonal Robustness**: Handles summer peaks (42°C) and winter lows (8°C)
- **Monsoon Adaptation**: Learns reduced PV during monsoon (Jun-Sep)
- **Better Generalization**: 10 years vs 1 month → 120x more scenarios

## Training Metrics Tracked

### Core Metrics (per episode):
1. **Return** - Total reward (higher is better, target: -50k to 0)
2. **Cost** - Total operational cost in ₹ (minimize)
3. **Emissions** - Total CO₂ in kg (minimize)
4. **Safety Violations** - Count per episode (target: < 5)
5. **Unmet Demand** - Blackout events (target: 0)

### Learning Metrics:
6. **Actor Loss** - Policy gradient loss
7. **Critic Loss** - Value estimation loss
8. **Entropy** - Policy exploration (should decay slowly)

### Visualization:
- **training_curves.png** - 6-panel plot showing all metrics
- **training_metrics.csv** - Full numerical log

## Usage Instructions

### Quick Start (Recommended)
```bash
cd microgrid-ems-drl
python train_ppo_improved.py
```

This will:
1. Load 10-year synthetic data (350k samples)
2. Train for 1000 episodes with optimized hyperparameters
3. Save best model every time return improves
4. Save checkpoints every 100 episodes
5. Generate training curves plot

### Training Configuration
Edit these parameters in `train_ppo_improved.py`:

```python
# In main():
num_episodes = 1000              # Total training episodes
safety_weight_multiplier = 3.0   # Increase to 5.0 if violations still high

# In ImprovedPPOAgent():
learning_rate = 1e-4             # Reduce to 5e-5 if unstable
batch_size = 2048                # Increase to 4096 if enough memory
entropy_coef = 0.01              # Increase to 0.02 for more exploration
```

### Monitoring Training
**During Training**:
```
Episode 10/1000
  Return: -123456.78 | Avg(100): -145678.90
  Cost: ₹145678.90 | Emissions: 18543.2 kg
  Safety Violations: 45 | Unmet: 0
  Actor Loss: 0.0234 | Critic Loss: 123.45 | Entropy: 0.012
```

**What to Look For**:
- ✅ **Return improving** over time (moving towards 0)
- ✅ **Safety violations decreasing** (target < 5)
- ✅ **Unmet demand = 0** (maintaining reliability)
- ✅ **Entropy > 0.001** (still exploring)
- ⚠️ **Cost & emissions decreasing** slowly

### If Training Fails

**Problem 1: Safety violations still high (> 20)**
```python
# Increase safety penalty
safety_weight_multiplier = 5.0  # or even 10.0
```

**Problem 2: Training unstable (oscillating returns)**
```python
# Reduce learning rate
learning_rate = 5e-5
# Increase batch size
batch_size = 4096
```

**Problem 3: Policy not exploring (entropy → 0 too fast)**
```python
# Increase entropy coefficient
entropy_coef = 0.02  # or 0.05
```

**Problem 4: Out of memory**
```python
# Reduce batch size
batch_size = 1024
minibatch_size = 256
```

## Evaluation After Training

### 1. Evaluate Best Model
```bash
python evaluate.py --model models/ppo_improved_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/best_model.pt
```

### 2. Compare with Baseline
```bash
# Create comparison script
python compare_models.py \
    --baseline models/ppo_20251004_101132/best_model.pt \
    --improved models/ppo_improved_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/best_model.pt

## Hyperparameter Tuning Priorities

If results are not satisfactory, tune in this order:

### Priority 1: Safety
```python
safety_weight_multiplier = [3.0, 5.0, 10.0, 20.0]
```

### Priority 2: Learning Rate
```python
learning_rate = [1e-4, 5e-5, 3e-5]
```

### Priority 3: Entropy
```python
entropy_coef = [0.01, 0.02, 0.05]
```

### Priority 4: Batch Size
```python
batch_size = [2048, 4096, 8192]  # if memory allows
```

### Quick Hyperparameter Sweep (8-12 runs):
```python
configs = [
    {'lr': 1e-4, 'safety': 3.0, 'entropy': 0.01},
    {'lr': 1e-4, 'safety': 5.0, 'entropy': 0.01},
    {'lr': 5e-5, 'safety': 3.0, 'entropy': 0.01},
    {'lr': 5e-5, 'safety': 5.0, 'entropy': 0.02},
    {'lr': 1e-4, 'safety': 10.0, 'entropy': 0.01},
    # ... run each for 200 episodes to find best combo
]
```

---

## Expected Timeline

### Phase 1: Sanity Check (100 episodes, ~2-4 hours)
- Verify code runs without errors
- Check safety violations trending down
- Confirm return improving

### Phase 2: Short Training (500 episodes, ~10-20 hours)
- Achieve stable learning
- Safety violations < 10
- Return > -80,000

### Phase 3: Full Training (1000 episodes, ~20-40 hours)
- Converge to near-optimal policy
- Safety violations < 5
- Return > -60,000

### Phase 4: Extended Training (2000+ episodes, optional)
- Fine-tune for competition
- Achieve production-ready policy

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "CUDA out of memory"
**Solution**: Reduce batch size or use CPU
```python
batch_size = 1024
minibatch_size = 256
```

### Issue: "File not found: synthetic data"
**Solution**: Check path or use original data
```python
# In train_ppo_improved.py:
use_full_csv = False  # Falls back to original data
```

### Issue: "Training very slow"
**Solution**: 
1. Reduce episodes for testing (100-200)
2. Use smaller neural networks
3. Reduce STEPS_PER_EPISODE in env_config.py

### Issue: "NaN losses"
**Solution**: Reduce learning rate
```python
learning_rate = 1e-5  # More conservative
```
