## 🎓 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Generation Algorithm

```
FOR each 15-minute timestep in 10 years:
    1. Calculate base seasonal pattern (sinusoidal)
    2. Add long-term trend (climate change)
    3. Apply daily cycle (diurnal variation)
    4. Add monsoon effects (cooling, clouds)
    5. Inject random weather noise
    6. Apply physical constraints
    7. Calculate correlated parameters
    8. Compute PV power output
END FOR
```

### Key Correlations Implemented

- **Temperature ↔ Irradiance**: Positive (sunny = hot)
- **Temperature ↔ Humidity**: Negative (hot = dry)
- **Irradiance ↔ PV Power**: Positive (more sun = more power)
- **Temperature → PV Efficiency**: Negative (hot reduces efficiency)
- **Monsoon → All**: Clouds reduce irradiance, increase humidity
