# üî• TIER 1: HIGH IMPACT FEATURES (Implement These First)

## 1. **Uncertainty-Aware Decision Making** üå§Ô∏è

### Problem
Current model assumes perfect forecasts. Real world has uncertain weather, demand, prices.

### Solution: Probabilistic Forecasting + Risk-Aware RL

**What it adds**:
- Weather forecast uncertainty (e.g., "70% chance of sun")
- Demand forecast confidence intervals
- Risk-sensitive decision making (conservative vs aggressive)

**Implementation**:
```python
class UncertaintyAwareAgent:
    """
    RL agent that considers forecast uncertainty
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.quantile_forecaster = QuantileForecaster()  # 10th, 50th, 90th percentile
        self.risk_preference = 0.5  # 0=risk-averse, 1=risk-seeking
    
    def predict_with_uncertainty(self, obs):
        # Get multiple forecast scenarios
        forecasts = {
            'pessimistic': self.quantile_forecaster.predict(obs, q=0.1),
            'expected': self.quantile_forecaster.predict(obs, q=0.5),
            'optimistic': self.quantile_forecaster.predict(obs, q=0.9)
        }
        
        # Evaluate action under each scenario
        actions = {}
        values = {}
        for scenario, forecast in forecasts.items():
            actions[scenario] = self.actor(forecast)
            values[scenario] = self.critic(forecast)
        
        # Risk-weighted decision
        if self.risk_preference < 0.3:
            # Conservative: choose action that works in worst case
            return actions['pessimistic']
        elif self.risk_preference > 0.7:
            # Aggressive: optimize for best case
            return actions['optimistic']
        else:
            # Balanced: expected value
            return actions['expected']
```

**Why it's impactful**:
- ‚úÖ Handles real-world uncertainty
- ‚úÖ More robust to forecast errors
- ‚úÖ Can adjust risk preference per stakeholder
- ‚úÖ Judges will appreciate practical considerations

**Effort**: 2-3 days

**Expected improvement**: +15-20% robustness, +10% cost savings

---

## 2. **Adaptive Reward Weighting (Meta-Learning)** üéöÔ∏è

### Problem
Currently: Fixed reward weights (alpha=4.15, beta=0.5, gamma=100)
- What if user wants to prioritize emissions over cost?
- What if regulations change?

### Solution: Learn optimal weights automatically

**What it adds**:
- Dynamic reward balancing based on context
- User preference adaptation
- Multi-objective Pareto optimization

**Implementation**:
```python
class AdaptiveRewardAgent:
    """
    Agent that learns optimal reward weights for different contexts
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.base_agent = PPOAgent()
        self.reward_weight_network = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(10, 64),  # Context features
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(64, 4),   # 4 weights: cost, emissions, degradation, reliability
            nn.Softmax()
        )
    
    def get_adaptive_weights(self, context):
        """
        Context = [time_of_day, season, grid_carbon_intensity, 
                   electricity_price, user_preference]
        """
        weights = self.reward_weight_network(context)
        return {
            'cost': weights[0],
            'emissions': weights[1],
            'degradation': weights[2],
            'reliability': weights[3]
        }
    
    def compute_reward(self, state, action, context):
        weights = self.get_adaptive_weights(context)
        
        cost = compute_cost(state, action)
        emissions = compute_emissions(state, action)
        degradation = compute_degradation(state, action)
        reliability = compute_reliability(state, action)
        
        # Dynamic weighting
        reward = -(
            weights['cost'] * cost +
            weights['emissions'] * emissions +
            weights['degradation'] * degradation +
            weights['reliability'] * reliability
        )
        
        return reward
```

**Use cases**:
- Morning peak: Prioritize reliability (high weights[3])
- Low carbon intensity: Prioritize cost (high weights[0])
- High emissions hour: Prioritize emissions (high weights[1])
- User "eco mode": Automatically adjust weights

**Why it's impactful**:
- ‚úÖ Flexible to changing priorities
- ‚úÖ Handles multiple stakeholders (cost-focused vs eco-focused)
- ‚úÖ Can show Pareto frontier (trade-off curves)
- ‚úÖ Great for demos: "Switch to eco mode" ‚Üí weights change live

**Effort**: 3-4 days

**Expected improvement**: +25% flexibility, enables "modes" (eco, cost, balanced)

## 3. **Hierarchical RL: Strategic + Tactical Planning** üß†

### Problem
Current: Single-level decision every 15 minutes
Missing: Long-term planning (day-ahead strategy)

### Solution: Two-level hierarchy

**High-Level Agent** (every 1 hour):
- Sets day-ahead strategy
- Decides: "Today is sunny ‚Üí plan to store solar for evening peak"

**Low-Level Agent** (every 15 min):
- Executes tactics
- Decides: "Charge battery at 450 kW now"

**Implementation**:
```python
class HierarchicalAgent:
    """
    Two-level RL: Strategic (hourly) + Tactical (15-min)
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.strategic_agent = StrategicPPO(obs_dim=50, action_dim=10)
        self.tactical_agent = TacticalPPO(obs_dim=90, action_dim=5)
    
    def strategic_decision(self, day_ahead_forecast):
        """
        High-level: Set goals for next 24 hours
        """
        strategy = self.strategic_agent.predict(day_ahead_forecast)
        
        # Strategy = [target_battery_soc_evening, 
        #             max_grid_import_today,
        #             renewable_curtailment_allowed,
        #             ev_charging_priority, ...]
        
        return strategy
    
    def tactical_decision(self, current_obs, strategy):
        """
        Low-level: Execute actions to achieve strategy
        """
        # Concatenate current observation + strategy
        augmented_obs = np.concatenate([current_obs, strategy])
        
        # Tactical agent follows strategy
        action = self.tactical_agent.predict(augmented_obs)
        
        return action
```

**Example scenario**:
```
6 AM: Strategic agent sees "sunny day ahead + evening peak pricing"
      ‚Üí Strategy: "Charge battery to 90% by 4 PM, save for 6-9 PM peak"

6:00 AM: Tactical agent: "Solar starting, charge at 200 kW"
6:15 AM: Tactical agent: "Solar increasing, charge at 400 kW"
...
4:00 PM: Tactical agent: "Battery 90% ‚úì, stop charging"
6:00 PM: Tactical agent: "Peak hour, discharge at 600 kW"
```

**Why it's impactful**:
- ‚úÖ Captures both short-term + long-term optimization
- ‚úÖ More realistic (humans think strategically + tactically)
- ‚úÖ Better day-ahead planning
- ‚úÖ Can explain: "Strategy is X, so I'm doing Y"

**Effort**: 5-7 days

**Expected improvement**: +10-15% cost savings from better planning

---

## 4. **Attention Mechanism for Time-Series** üëÅÔ∏è

### Problem
Current: Observation is flat 90-dim vector
Missing: Focus on important features

### Solution: Transformer-style attention

**What it adds**:
- Model learns what to pay attention to
- Better handling of long sequences (2-hour forecasts)
- Explainable: "I'm focusing on solar forecast right now"

**Implementation**:
```python
class AttentionPPO(nn.Module):
    """
    PPO with attention mechanism for time-series observations
    """
    def __init__(self, obs_dim, action_dim):
        super().__init__()
        
        # Temporal attention for forecasts
        self.temporal_attention = nn.MultiheadAttention(
            embed_dim=64,
            num_heads=4
        )
        
        # Feature attention
        self.feature_attention = nn.Linear(obs_dim, obs_dim)
        
        # Actor/Critic networks
        self.actor = nn.Sequential(...)
        self.critic = nn.Sequential(...)
    
    def forward(self, obs):
        # obs shape: (batch, sequence_length, features)
        # Example: (32, 8, 90) = 32 samples, 8 timesteps (2 hours), 90 features
        
        # 1. Temporal attention: Which timestep matters?
        attended_temporal, attention_weights_temporal = self.temporal_attention(
            obs, obs, obs
        )
        
        # 2. Feature attention: Which feature matters?
        attention_weights_feature = torch.softmax(
            self.feature_attention(attended_temporal), dim=-1
        )
        attended_obs = attended_temporal * attention_weights_feature
        
        # 3. Policy and value
        action_logits = self.actor(attended_obs)
        value = self.critic(attended_obs)
        
        return action_logits, value, {
            'temporal_attention': attention_weights_temporal,
            'feature_attention': attention_weights_feature
        }
```

```

**Why it's impactful**:
- ‚úÖ Better performance with long forecasts
- ‚úÖ Explainable AI: See what agent focuses on
- ‚úÖ Impressive visualization for demos
- ‚úÖ Research-level technique (publications!)

**Effort**: 4-5 days

**Expected improvement**: +5-10% performance, +100% explainability

    """
    def __init__(self, base_agent):
        self.agent = base_agent
        self.replay_buffer = OnlineReplayBuffer(maxsize=50000)
        self.performance_monitor = PerformanceMonitor()
        
        # Thresholds for retraining
        self.retrain_threshold = 0.15  # 15% performance drop
        self.min_new_samples = 1000
    
    def act(self, obs):

        baseline_perf = self.performance_monitor.baseline_performance
        
        drop = (baseline_perf - recent_perf) / baseline_perf
        
        if drop > self.retrain_threshold and len(self.replay_buffer) >= self.min_new_samples:
            return True, drop
        return False, drop
    
    def online_update(self, num_epochs=5):

        """
        print(f"üîÑ Online learning: Updating with {len(self.replay_buffer)} new samples")
        
        # Sample mini-batches from replay buffer
        for epoch in range(num_epochs):
            batch = self.replay_buffer.sample(batch_size=256)

## 7. **Multi-Agent RL: Coordinated Microgrids** ü§ù

### Problem
Current: Single microgrid
Real world: Multiple microgrids that can trade energy

### Solution: Multi-agent coordination

**What it adds**:
- Multiple agents (one per microgrid)
- Peer-to-peer energy trading
- Cooperative optimization

**Implementation**:

    def coordinate_actions(self, actions, trades):
        """
        Adjust actions based on peer-to-peer trades
        """
        for trade in trades:
            seller_id = trade['seller']
            buyer_id = trade['buyer']
            energy = trade['energy_kwh']

**Example scenario**:
```
Microgrid A: Excess solar (2000 kW)
Microgrid B: High load, no sun (1500 kW)

Without coordination:
- A exports 2000 kW to grid at ‚Çπ3/kWh = ‚Çπ6000
- B imports 1500 kW from grid at ‚Çπ6/kWh = ‚Çπ9000
- Total: ‚Çπ15000

With coordination:
- A sells 1500 kW to B at ‚Çπ4.5/kWh = ‚Çπ6750
- A exports 500 kW to grid = ‚Çπ1500
- Total: ‚Çπ8250
- Savings: ‚Çπ6750 (45%)
```

**Why it's game-changing**:
- ‚úÖ Real-world application (community microgrids)
- ‚úÖ Shows innovation (beyond single site)
- ‚úÖ Solves complex coordination problem
- ‚úÖ Impressive for judges

**Effort**: 10-14 days

**Expected improvement**: +30-50% cost savings in multi-microgrid scenario

## 8. **Imitation Learning from Expert Demonstrations** üë®‚Äçüè´

### Problem
Current: Learn from scratch (trial and error)
Missing: Bootstrap from expert knowledge

### Solution: Learn from human operators first, then improve

**What it adds**:
- Faster training (starts from good policy)
- Incorporates domain expertise
- Can explain: "This is how experts do it"

**Implementation**:
```python
class ImitationPPOAgent:
    """
    Agent that learns from expert demonstrations first
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.agent = PPOAgent()
        self.expert_buffer = ExpertDemonstrationBuffer()
    
    def pretrain_from_expert(self, expert_data):
        """
        Phase 1: Imitation learning (supervised)
        """
        print("üìö Phase 1: Learning from expert demonstrations...")
        
        for epoch in range(100):
            batch = expert_data.sample(batch_size=256)
            
            # Supervised learning: Predict expert's action
            predicted_action = self.agent.actor(batch['states'])
            expert_action = batch['actions']
            
            # Behavioral cloning loss
            loss = F.mse_loss(predicted_action, expert_action)
            loss.backward()
            
            if epoch % 10 == 0:
                print(f"Epoch {epoch}: Imitation loss = {loss.item():.4f}")
        
        print("‚úì Phase 1 complete. Agent can now mimic expert.")
    
    def finetune_with_rl(self, env, episodes=1000):
        """
        Phase 2: RL fine-tuning (improve beyond expert)
        """
        print("üéØ Phase 2: RL fine-tuning to surpass expert...")
        
        # Regular PPO training, but starting from expert policy
        train_ppo(self.agent, env, episodes)
        
        print("‚úì Phase 2 complete. Agent surpassed expert!")
```

**Expert demonstrations**:

- Human operator logs
- Optimal control solutions (if available)

**Why it's game-changing**:
- ‚úÖ Faster convergence (2x-5x speedup)
- ‚úÖ More stable training
- ‚úÖ Combines human expertise + AI learning
- ‚úÖ Can show: "Started from expert, now 20% better"

**Effort**: 5-7 days

**Expected improvement**: +50% training speed, +10% final performance

## 9. **Explainable AI with Counterfactuals** üîç

### Problem
Current: Black box decisions
Missing: "Why did you do X instead of Y?"

### Solution: Generate counterfactual explanations

**What it adds**:
- Answer: "I charged battery because if I didn't, cost would be 20% higher"
- Interactive "what-if" analysis
- Trust and transparency

**Implementation**:
```python
class ExplainableAgent:
    """
    Agent with counterfactual explanation capability
    """
    def __init__(self, agent, env):
        self.agent = agent
        self.env = env
    
    def explain_action(self, state, action_taken):
        """
        Generate counterfactual: "What if I did something else?"
        """
        # 1. Actual action and outcome
        actual_reward = self.env.get_reward(state, action_taken)
        
        # 2. Generate alternative actions
        alternatives = []
        for _ in range(10):
            alt_action = sample_alternative_action()
            alt_reward = self.env.get_reward(state, alt_action)
            
            alternatives.append({
                'action': alt_action,
                'reward': alt_reward,
                'description': self.describe_action(alt_action)
            })
        
        # 3. Find best alternative
        best_alt = max(alternatives, key=lambda x: x['reward'])
        
        # 4. Generate explanation
        if actual_reward >= best_alt['reward']:
            explanation = f"‚úì Best choice! Alternatives would be {(best_alt['reward'] - actual_reward):.1f}% worse."
        else:
            explanation = f"‚ö† Sub-optimal. {best_alt['description']} would be {(best_alt['reward'] - actual_reward):.1f}% better."
        
        return {
            'action_taken': self.describe_action(action_taken),
            'actual_reward': actual_reward,
            'alternatives': alternatives,
            'explanation': explanation
        }
    
    def describe_action(self, action):
        """
        Convert action vector to human-readable description
        """
        battery_power = action[0]
        grid_power = action[2]
        
        if battery_power > 0:
            desc = f"Charge battery at {battery_power:.0f} kW"
        elif battery_power < 0:
            desc = f"Discharge battery at {-battery_power:.0f} kW"
        else:
            desc = "Battery idle"
        
        if grid_power > 0:
            desc += f", import {grid_power:.0f} kW from grid"
        elif grid_power < 0:
            desc += f", export {-grid_power:.0f} kW to grid"
        
        return desc
```

**Example explanation**:
```
Time: 14:30, Decision: Charge battery at 500 kW

Explanation:
‚úì This was the best choice!

Counterfactuals considered:
1. Do nothing (idle)
   ‚Üí Result: Miss free solar, cost +‚Çπ1,250
   
2. Charge at 300 kW (less aggressive)
   ‚Üí Result: Under-utilize solar, cost +‚Çπ400
   
3. Export to grid immediately
   ‚Üí Result: Sell at ‚Çπ3/kWh, but evening peak is ‚Çπ9/kWh
   ‚Üí Opportunity cost: ‚Çπ3,000
   
Conclusion: Charging at 500 kW stores free solar for 
expensive evening peak. Savings: ‚Çπ3,000 vs next best option.
```

**Why it's game-changing**:
- ‚úÖ Builds trust (can verify decisions)
- ‚úÖ Great for demos and presentations
- ‚úÖ Helps debugging (why did it fail?)
- ‚úÖ Judges love explainable AI

**Effort**: 4-6 days

**Expected improvement**: +100% trust, +50% explainability score
