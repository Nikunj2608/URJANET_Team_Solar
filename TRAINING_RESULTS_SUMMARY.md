## 💡 Why the Return is Negative (Explained Simply)

### The Math:
```python
Return = -(Cost + Emissions_Penalty + Safety_Penalty + Reliability_Penalty)
```

### Why Negative?
**Because we're measuring COSTS, not PROFITS:**
- Running a microgrid **costs money** (electricity bills)
- Using grid power **creates emissions** (penalty)
- Violating safety **damages equipment** (penalty)
- Blackouts **lose productivity** (penalty)

### Goal: Make it "Less Negative"
- Bad AI: Return = -150,000 (high costs)
- Good AI: Return = -90,000 (medium costs)
- **Our AI**: Return = **-53,585** (low costs!) ✓

### Could it be Positive?
**Yes, on solar-heavy days when we sell excess energy:**
- Generate 5000 kW solar
- Use only 2000 kW
- Sell 3000 kW × ₹9.50 = ₹28,500 revenue
- If revenue > costs → Positive return!

**But most days**, we consume more than we generate → Negative return

**Analogy**: Like golf scores—lower (more negative but smaller magnitude) is better!
