**Problem 1: High Operational Costs**
- Electricity bills ranging from 7 to 10 rupees per kilowatt-hour
- Peak demand charges reaching 9.50 rupees per kilowatt-hour during high-usage periods
- Time-of-Use tariff variations creating 100% price differences between off-peak and peak hours

- Complex coordination between solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, grid connection, and EV charging stations

**Problem 2: Environmental Impact**

### Three-Layer Architecture

**Layer 1: Physical Assets Layer**
This is the foundation layer containing all real hardware equipment being controlled.

Components in Physical Layer:

- Wind turbine system with 1 megawatt generation capacity
- Battery Storage System 1: 3 megawatt-hour capacity with plus minus 600 kilowatt power rating

- Electric vehicle charging infrastructure with 3 stations, 10 ports, total 122 kilowatt capacity
- Building loads including residential and commercial demands averaging 1,800 kilowatts

Data flow from Physical Layer:
- Sensors measure power output, voltage, current, state of charge, state of health, temperature every 15 minutes
- All measurements transmitted to AI Control Layer for processing
- Control commands received from AI Layer executed by local controllers

**Layer 2: AI Control Brain**
This is the intelligence layer where decisions are made using deep reinforcement learning.

Input to AI Control Brain (90-dimensional observation space):
- Temporal features: hour of day encoded as sine and cosine, day of week, month, season, weekend indicator
- Current renewable generation: solar power now, wind power now
- Renewable forecasts: solar power at 1 hour ahead, 2 hours ahead, wind power at 1 hour ahead, 2 hours ahead
- Current load: building electricity demand now
- Load forecasts: demand at 1 hour ahead, 2 hours ahead
- Battery 1 state: state of charge percentage, state of health percentage, temperature celsius, current power, cycle count, throughput
- Battery 2 state: state of charge percentage, state of health percentage, temperature celsius, current power, cycle count, throughput
- Grid economics: current electricity price rupees per kilowatt-hour, price at 1 hour ahead, price at 2 hours ahead, carbon dioxide emission factor
- EV status: number of vehicles connected, total energy needed, departure times, current charging power
- System status: unmet demand, safety violations count, time since last violation

AI Processing (PPO Algorithm):
- Actor neural network: Takes 90 inputs, processes through 3 hidden layers with 256, 128, 64 neurons, outputs 10 values representing means and standard deviations for 5 actions
- Critic neural network: Takes 90 inputs, processes through 3 hidden layers with 256, 128, 64 neurons, outputs single value representing state quality
- Training: Agent learns from 1,000 episodes, each episode is 24 hours with 96 decision points, total 96,000 learning opportunities
- Objective: Maximize cumulative reward which is negative cost plus emissions plus degradation

Output from AI Control Brain (5-dimensional continuous action space):

- EV charging power command: value between 0 and 122 kilowatts
- Renewable curtailment: value between 0 and 1, where 0 means use all renewable energy, 1 means curtail all

**Layer 3: Safety Supervisor**
This is the safety layer that guarantees no failures or blackouts regardless of AI decisions.

Hard Constraints Enforced:
- Constraint 1 Power Balance: Total generation must equal total demand at all times within 1 kilowatt tolerance
- Constraint 2 Battery State of Charge: Must stay between 20% minimum and 90% maximum to protect battery health
- Constraint 3 Battery Power Limits: Battery 1 limited to plus minus 600 kilowatts, Battery 2 limited to plus minus 200 kilowatts based on C-rate specifications

Safety Supervisor Process:
Step 1: AI proposes action with 5 values
Step 2: Safety supervisor validates each constraint
Step 3: If any constraint violated, action is automatically corrected to nearest safe value
Step 4: Corrected safe action is executed on physical equipment
Step 5: Violations are logged for analysis but do not affect operation
Result: Mathematical guarantee of zero blackouts and zero equipment damage

### Key Innovation: Proactive vs Reactive

**Traditional Reactive Systems**
- Wait for events to occur
- React to current conditions only
- No forward planning capability
- Fixed rules that cannot adapt
- Example: Peak hour arrives, system forced to use expensive grid power because battery was not pre-charged

**Our AI Proactive System**
- Predicts conditions 2 hours ahead using forecasts
- Plans strategically across multiple time steps
- Learns patterns from 10 years of data
- Adapts continuously to new patterns
- Example: AI sees peak hour coming in 2 hours, charges battery NOW at 4.50 rupees per kilowatt-hour off-peak rate, then discharges during peak at 9.50 rupees per kilowatt-hour, saving 5 rupees per kilowatt-hour

Real World Scenario Comparison:
Scenario: Peak pricing period starting at 6 PM, currently 4 PM with off-peak rates

Traditional System Actions:
- Time 4 PM: Does nothing, off-peak rates not prioritized
- Time 6 PM: Peak rates begin at 9.50 rupees per kilowatt-hour
- Time 6 PM: Battery has only 30% charge, insufficient for evening demand
- Time 6 PM to 10 PM: Forced to import 1000 kilowatts from grid at 9.50 rupees per kilowatt-hour
- Total cost: 1000 kilowatts times 4 hours times 9.50 rupees equals 38,000 rupees

AI Proactive System Actions:
- Time 4 PM: AI analyzes forecast, predicts peak demand from 6 PM to 10 PM
- Time 4 PM to 6 PM: Charges battery at 4.50 rupees per kilowatt-hour to 80% state of charge
- Time 6 PM to 10 PM: Discharges battery to meet demand, minimizes grid import
- Grid import reduced to 200 kilowatts average
- Total cost: 800 kilowatts battery charge at 4.50 rupees plus 200 kilowatts grid at 9.50 rupees equals 11,200 rupees
- Savings: 38,000 minus 11,200 equals 26,800 rupees for one evening, scaling to 1.31 crore rupees annually

### Multi-Objective Optimization

**Objective 1: Minimize Energy Costs**
- Reduce grid electricity purchases especially during peak hours
- Maximize solar and wind utilization which have zero marginal cost
- Time-shift energy usage from expensive to cheap hours using battery storage
- Export excess renewable energy to grid during profitable periods
- Target: 36% cost reduction achieved, 40 to 50% expected with full training

**Objective 2: Minimize Carbon Emissions**
- Prioritize renewable energy over grid power which emits 0.82 kilograms carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour
- Import from grid during off-peak hours when carbon intensity is lower at 0.70 kilograms per kilowatt-hour
- Avoid peak hours when carbon intensity is higher at 0.95 kilograms per kilowatt-hour
- Zero curtailment of renewable energy whenever possible
- Target: 39% emission reduction achieved

**Objective 3: Minimize Battery Degradation**
- Avoid deep discharge cycles below 20% state of charge
- Avoid overcharging above 90% state of charge
- Manage thermal stress by limiting power during high temperature conditions
- Reduce cycle count through intelligent charge-discharge patterns
- Penalty cost of 12.45 rupees per kilowatt-hour throughput
- Target: 20 to 30% battery life extension

**Objective 4: Guarantee Reliability**
- Zero unmet demand at all times enforced by safety supervisor
- Maintain minimum 20% battery reserve for emergency backup
- Power balance equation satisfied every 15 minutes
- Penalty of 830 rupees per kilowatt-hour for any unmet demand
- Target: 100% reliability achieved, zero blackouts in testing

**Reward Function Mathematical Formulation**
Reward at time t equals negative of total cost at time t
Total cost equals grid cost plus emission cost plus degradation cost plus penalty cost
Grid cost equals grid import power times price times 0.25 hours minus grid export power times export price times 0.25 hours
Emission cost equals grid import power times carbon dioxide factor times 0.25 hours times 4.15 rupees per kilogram
Degradation cost equals battery throughput times 12.45 rupees per kilowatt-hour times 0.5 weight factor
Penalty cost equals unmet demand times 830 rupees per kilowatt-hour plus safety violations times 8300 rupees each times 100 multiplier
