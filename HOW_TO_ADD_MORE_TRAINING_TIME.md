## 🔧 Customization Guide

### **1. Faster Training (Shorter Time)**

For quick experiments or debugging:

```python
num_episodes=1000,              # 1 hour
eval_interval=50,               
save_interval=100,
safety_weight_multiplier=1.0
```

**Use case:** Testing code changes, debugging crashes

---

### **2. Balanced Training (Recommended)** ✅

Good balance of time and performance:

```python
num_episodes=10000,             # 10 hours ✅
eval_interval=50,               
save_interval=100,
safety_weight_multiplier=1.0
```

**Use case:** Production training, hackathon submission

---

### **3. Maximum Performance**

For best possible results:

```python
num_episodes=20000,             # 20 hours
eval_interval=100,              # Less frequent evals
save_interval=200,              # Less frequent saves
safety_weight_multiplier=0.5    # More aggressive
```

**Use case:** Final optimization, competition submission

---

### **4. Ultra-Fast Training (Testing Only)**

For rapid iteration during development:

```python
num_episodes=100,               # 6 minutes
eval_interval=10,               
save_interval=50,
safety_weight_multiplier=1.0
```

**Use case:** Testing training loop, debugging reward function

---

## 📈 Training Progress Monitoring

### **Watch Training in Real-Time:**

```bash
# Method 1: Watch the console output
# Training prints progress every 10 episodes

# Method 2: Check log files
Get-Content logs/ppo_improved_TIMESTAMP/training.log -Wait

# Method 3: Plot training curves (run after training starts)
# Opens after every eval_interval
logs/ppo_improved_TIMESTAMP/training_curves.png
```

### **What to Look For:**

```
✅ GOOD SIGNS:
Episode 1000: Cost: ₹250,000  (high at start)
Episode 2000: Cost: ₹180,000  (decreasing)
Episode 5000: Cost: ₹90,000   (getting better)
Episode 10000: Cost: ₹52,000  (goal achieved!) ✅

❌ BAD SIGNS:
Episode 1000: Cost: ₹250,000
Episode 2000: Cost: ₹280,000  (increasing - problem!)
Episode 5000: Cost: ₹300,000  (not learning - debug!)
```

---

## ⏱️ Time Estimation

### **Factors Affecting Training Time:**

1. **CPU Speed:** Faster CPU = faster training
2. **Number of Episodes:** Linear scaling
3. **Steps per Episode:** 96 steps (fixed)
4. **Network Complexity:** Current: 256x256 (medium)

### **Approximate Times (on typical laptop):**

```
Your System Specs Matter:
- Fast CPU (i7/i9):     ~6-8 hours for 10k episodes
- Medium CPU (i5):      ~10-12 hours for 10k episodes
- Slow CPU (i3):        ~15-18 hours for 10k episodes
```

### **Calculate Your Time:**

```python
# Measure first 100 episodes:
Start time: 10:00 AM
After 100 episodes: 10:35 AM
Time for 100: 35 minutes

# Estimate 10,000 episodes:
Time = (35 min / 100) * 10,000 = 3,500 min = 58 hours

# More realistic (training speeds up):
Time = 3,500 min * 0.7 = 2,450 min = 41 hours
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Training Time Issues

### **Problem 1: Training Too Slow**

**Symptoms:**
- 100 episodes takes > 2 hours
- Progress bar barely moves

**Solutions:**
```python
# 1. Reduce environment complexity
steps_per_episode = 96  # Don't change (24h/15min)

# 2. Reduce network size (faster but less accurate)
hidden_size = 128  # Was 256 (2x faster, ~10% worse performance)

# 3. Reduce batch size (faster updates)
batch_size = 32  # Was 64 (faster but noisier)

# 4. Skip some evaluations
eval_interval = 100  # Was 50 (less overhead)
```

---

### **Problem 2: Training Crashes Midway**

**Symptoms:**
- Training stops after N hours
- Memory error or NaN values

**Solutions:**
```python
# 1. Add gradient clipping (prevents NaN)
grad_clip = 0.5  # Already enabled

# 2. Reduce batch size (less memory)
batch_size = 32  # Was 64

# 3. Save more frequently
save_interval = 50  # Was 100 (lose less progress)

# 4. Enable auto-resume (add to main())
if os.path.exists('checkpoints/latest.pt'):
    agent.load('checkpoints/latest.pt')
    print("Resumed from checkpoint")
```

---

### **Problem 3: Not Learning After Many Episodes**

**Symptoms:**
- Cost stays high (₹200k+) after 5000 episodes
- No improvement in metrics

**Debug checklist:**
```python
# 1. Check reward function
print(f"Reward: {reward}")  # Should be negative (cost)
# If all zeros: reward function broken

# 2. Check learning rate
learning_rate = 3e-4  # Try higher (was 1e-4)

# 3. Check exploration
entropy_coeff = 0.02  # Increase (was 0.01)

# 4. Check data quality
# Ensure synthetic data is realistic
```

---
