3. **Indian emission factors** (0.82 kg CO₂/kWh)
4. **Typical commercial load** pattern

### ✅ Diversity
1. **Weather variability**: 2.29x difference between days
2. **Time-of-day patterns**: Morning/evening peaks
3. **Price volatility**: 3x difference peak vs off-peak
4. **Surplus/deficit cycles**: 387 surplus + 613 deficit periods

### ✅ Challenge Level
1. **High renewable penetration**: 86.7% (ambitious but realistic)
2. **Frequent transitions**: Surplus ↔ Deficit every 2-3 hours
3. **Load-gen mismatch**: Peak load at 19:00, peak solar at 8:00

## 📊 WHAT THE RL AGENT LEARNS

### Patterns the Agent Discovers:

1. **Morning Strategy** (6-12h):
   - Solar ramping up
   - Load increasing
   - Normal pricing (₹7.48/kWh)
   - **Action**: Charge batteries from surplus solar

2. **Midday Strategy** (12-14h):
   - Peak solar generation
   - Lunch-time load dip
   - Entering peak pricing (₹9.51/kWh)
   - **Action**: Maximize self-consumption, charge batteries

3. **Evening Strategy** (18-22h):
   - Solar declining/zero
   - Highest load demand
   - Peak pricing (₹9.51/kWh)
   - **Action**: Discharge batteries, avoid grid import

4. **Night Strategy** (22-6h):
   - No solar
   - Base load only
   - Off-peak pricing (₹4.53/kWh)
   - **Action**: Import from grid if needed (cheap)
